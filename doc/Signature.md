# Sprint Signature

| Date        | Time Spent | Events
|-------------|------------|--------------------
| February 02 |  1   hour  | Completed new Shell Tutor modules and pushed my certificate.
| February 03 |  2   hours | Completed Phase 0 of the SDP and a lot of Phase 1 (couldn't figure out cut, paste, and wc)
| February 04 | 1.25 hours | Wrote cat, tac, grep, sort, head and tail based on my Plan.md pseudocode and they provide correct output when called from their own files. I made a preliminary pseudocode modification for the driver tt.py that didn't provide any meaningful output. Did some google research about how to accept arguments from the command line and learned about getOpt, which is likely not allowed in this assignment. 
| February 05 |  1   hour  | Revised tt.py so it called the correct tool and passed on the relevant arguments for each of the tools I have completed. Worked on the tool paste and was able to see that it ran through all of my code correctly, but wasn't appending lines to the array I had created to print everything. I think tomorrow I will try to print instead of appending to an array and printing from that array afterwards.
| TOTAL       | 5.25 hours | *Your TOTAL should agree with your daily entries*
